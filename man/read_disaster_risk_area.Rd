\title{Download official data of disaster risk areas as an sf object.}
\usage{
read_disaster_risk_area(year = 2010, simplified = TRUE, showProgress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{A year number in YYYY format (defaults to 2010)}

\item{simplified}{Logic FALSE or TRUE, indicating whether the function returns the
data set with 'original' resolution or a data set with 'simplified' borders (Defaults to TRUE).
For spatial analysis and statistics users should set simplified = FALSE. Borders have been
simplified by removing vertices of borders using st_simplify{sf} preserving topology with a dTolerance of 100.}

\item{showProgress}{Logical. Defaults to (TRUE) display progress bar}
}
\description{
This function reads the the official data of disaster risk areas in Brazil. It specifically focuses
on geodynamic and hydro-meteorological disasters capable of triggering landslides and floods. The
data set covers the whole country. Each risk area polygon (known as 'BATER') has unique code id (column 'geo_bater').
The data set brings information on the extent to which the risk area polygons overlap with census
tracts and block faces (column "acuracia") and number of ris areas within each risk area (column 'num').
Orignal data were generated by IBGE and CEMADEN. For more information about the methodology, see deails
at https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/tipologias-do-territorio/21538-populacao-em-areas-de-risco-no-brasil.html
